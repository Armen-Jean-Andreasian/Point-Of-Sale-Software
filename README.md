## Description

This Point of Sale (POS) software project is designed to streamline the sales process for businesses. It offers a user-friendly interface that allows for quick product identification, whether through manual input or barcode scanning (depending on the store's setup). The software connects to a MySQL database to retrieve item details such as ID, name, and price, enabling accurate and efficient transaction processing.

One of the key features of this software is its ability to generate itemized receipts, displaying product names, quantities, and prices per item. It calculates and displays the total amount to be paid, providing a comprehensive summary for both the cashier and the customer. Additionally, the software automatically generates PDF receipts, making it easy to print and adapt to various receipt printing machines.
